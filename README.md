# Identifying Health Insurance Claim Frauds

## Overview
Identifying fraudulent health insurance claims is crucial for minimizing financial losses and ensuring the integrity of insurance systems. This project focuses on detecting fraudulent claims using data-driven techniques, machine learning models, and statistical analysis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand claim patterns
- Feature engineering for enhanced model performance
- Application of machine learning models for fraud detection
- Performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- TensorFlow/Keras (optional) for deep learning models

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/identifying_health_insurance_claim_frauds.git
   cd identifying_health_insurance_claim_frauds
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```sh
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
4. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
   ```
5. Evaluate the model:
   ```sh
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:
- Claim details (amount, provider, diagnosis, etc.)
- Patient demographics
- Historical claim patterns
- Label indicating fraudulent or legitimate claim

## Usage
1. Modify `config.py` to set dataset paths and hyperparameters.
2. Run `train_model.py` to train the model.
3. Use `predict.py` to make predictions on new claims.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
